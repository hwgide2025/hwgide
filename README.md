# EchoFrame

## What is it?

EchoFrame is a fullstack project, where the front end takes a photo using the user's webcam and delivers it to the back end.  The back end parses the image and determines the emotion.  That emotion is searched for on Spotify, and a song is selected.  That song is then returned to the front end and played for the user.

## Usage

You can view the full app at [goodbye-world-2025.netlify.app](https://goodbye-world-2025.netlify.app). (If the host is working properly)

## Challenges we faced
No one in our team had ever made a functional backend, nor a eye-catching frontend.  No one in our team had ever used ngrok for tunnels.  Our team was unable to help for some of the time, as they had to study.  The host for the frontend, Netlify, was challenging to deploy properly, as the deployment often ended up in a blank screen.  Our team had never had to interface a front and back end before.

## What we are proud of
While everyone in our team was completely new to hackathons, we stepped up and were able to complete a project.  Though due to the actions of one teammate we were unable to submit the project until an hour after it was due, we were still able to get the project complete.  We got ngrok to function properly, we were able to use teammates hardware to create a backend that runs continuously.

## What's Next
This system can be adapted to phones with a possible mobile app, and we could expand and speed up our image processing time, which would decrease the time users spend waiting.

## Built With
Python, React, JS, git, CSS

#### Why a bunch of code was just added after this
So I never added the backend to the GitHub repo, and so I am adding it right after this is commited.

#### Other thoughts
Also if the front end looks weird, then this might be the out of date version of it, check my repos for the other verison.  This change was required to hard reset a broken Netlify project.

Any further changes to this project may be available in a GitHub repo on one of my main GitHub accounts.  The changes may also not be pushed to GitHub, it depends on whether of not I continue to use Netlify to host the frontend.
